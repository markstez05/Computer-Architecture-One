Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

    It stores data in multiple places allowing things to be accessed out of order instead of one by one.

Describe assembly language and machine language:

    Assembly language is the brigde between the machine language and the instructions. The machine language (binary, hex) are
    instructions that the pc responds to.

Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
    The graphics processor can handle data rather than relying on the CPU to do so.

Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

    GPUs enable things like facial recognition and image classification allowing the advancement of machine learning.
